AUDIO DEBUGGING NOTES
=====================

When you wake up and test the game:

1. OPEN BROWSER CONSOLE (F12)
   - Press F12 in Chrome/Edge before starting game
   - Look for audio loading messages when you press Enter

2. WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE:
   ✅ "🎵 Loading audio files..."
   ✅ "✅ Loaded: exorcism-assets/sounds/exrocism/..."
   ✅ "🎵 Audio loading complete. Loaded: 10 evil voices"

   EVERY 5-10 SECONDS:
   ✅ "👹 Playing evil voice #X"

3. IF YOU SEE ERRORS:
   ❌ "Failed to load" errors = Path problem or CORS issue

   SOLUTIONS:
   a) Make sure file paths match exactly
   b) Try opening HTML file using a local web server instead of file://

   To run local web server (Python):
   - Open Command Prompt in Desktop folder
   - Run: python -m http.server 8000
   - Open: http://localhost:8000/exorcism-game.html

4. CURRENT AUDIO SETUP:
   - Opening sound: opening1.mp3
   - 10 Evil voices (play randomly every 5-10 seconds):
     * crawled.mp3
     * iwas.mp3
     * keystrokes.mp3
     * louder.mp3
     * nobles.mp3
     * trembles.mp3
     * feedhope.mp3
     * foolishmortal.mp3
     * tooslow.mp3
     * hardrives.mp3
   - Win scream: tooslow.mp3

5. WHAT'S FIXED TODAY:
   ✅ Blessing words now SPAWN in the code as white text
   ✅ Huge white ripples emanate from blessed words
   ✅ Snake-like swarm with leader movement
   ✅ Glitching/cursed visual effects
   ✅ UI text hidden
   ✅ Audio files linked (just need to debug loading)
   ✅ Enhanced console logging for debugging

6. TO TEST BLESSINGS:
   - Say "holy" or "light" or any blessing word
   - You should see the word appear multiple times in white
   - Huge ripples should spread out
   - Console should show: "✝️ BLESSING: "holy" | Volume: X | Coverage: Y%"

Sleep well! 😴
The game is nearly complete - just need to verify audio loading tomorrow.
