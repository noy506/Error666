==================================

WHAT'S NEW:
-----------
✅ Complete 6-phase animation sequence before gameplay
✅ Blessed text typed from top-left corner in white
✅ Swarm CANNOT enter blessed areas (collision detection)
✅ Each blessing = 3 lines of white text
✅ Swarm breathing synced to microphone volume
✅ Black vignette, wave distortion, jitter effects
✅ 4-second decay delay

PHASE SEQUENCE:
---------------

1. TERMINAL BOOT (Auto-types)
   - System messages appear line by line
   - Blinking cursor

2. ACCESS GRANTED / ERROR 666 (3 seconds)
   - Green "ACCESS GRANTED"
   - Red "ERROR 666"
   - Row of >>> symbols

3. VOICE SYNC (plays opening1.mp3)
   - "POSSESSION IN PROGRESS..." with glitch
   - Automatically advances when audio ends

4. CODE FLOOD (Rapid typing)
   - Evil demonic code floods screen
   - Comments like "Your prayers cannot compile here"
   - 666 references

5. CONSTANT EFFECTS (2 seconds)
   - Black vignette fades in
   - Wave distortion starts
   - Jitter begins (every 3 seconds)

6. SWARM FORMATION (3 seconds)
   - Code breaks into particle swarm
   - Characters start moving
   - Serpentine leader movement

7. PLAYING MODE - YOUR TURN!
   - Speak blessing words
   - White text typed from top-left
   - Swarm bounces off blessed areas
   - Fill entire screen with white to win

GAMEPLAY MECHANICS:
-------------------

BLESSING WORDS:
- Say any blessing word from the list (holy, divine, light, etc.)
- Word is typed 3 times (3 lines) in white at current position
- Position starts at top-left, moves down with each blessing

SWARM COLLISION:
- Swarm characters check if they would enter blessed area
- If yes, they BOUNCE AWAY (velocity reversed)
- Leader also bounces off blessed areas
- Creates progressive "jails" for the swarm

BREATHING EFFECT:
- Swarm expands/contracts based on microphone volume
- Baseline breathing even when silent
- When demon voice plays loud, swarm grows
- When quiet, swarm shrinks

DECAY MECHANIC:
- Blessed areas stay white for 4 seconds (grace period)
- After 4 seconds, they start fading
- Decay rate: 0.25 strength per second
- Completely dark after ~4 more seconds
- MUST keep blessing to maintain pressure

WIN CONDITION:
- Fill entire screen with blessed text (all lines)
- OR say instant win: "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"

TARGET PLAYTIME: 2-3 MINUTES
-----------------------------
Typical screen: ~40 lines
Each blessing: 3 lines
Need: ~13-14 blessings to win
With decay: must bless every ~5-6 seconds to maintain

AUDIO:
------
- Opening sound: opening1.mp3 (Phase 3)
- Evil voices: Play every 8-15 seconds during gameplay
- Win scream: tooslow.mp3
- Microphone: Used for breathing intensity

CONTROLS:
---------
ENTER - Start game
R - Restart
ESC - Exit
VOICE - Speak blessing words

CONFIGURATION (edit CONFIG in HTML):
-------------------------------------
linesPerBlessing: 3       // Lines per blessing
decayDelay: 4000          // 4 seconds before decay
decayRate: 0.25           // Decay speed
leaderSpeed: 2.5          // Swarm leader speed
breathSpeed: 0.4          // Breathing animation speed
breathAmount: 40          // Breathing intensity
jitterInterval: 3000      // Jitter every 3 seconds

TESTING CHECKLIST:
------------------
[ ] Open in Chrome/Edge
[ ] Press Enter - watch full animation sequence
[ ] Microphone permission requested
[ ] Phase 1: Terminal text types out
[ ] Phase 2: "ERROR 666" appears
[ ] Phase 3: Opening audio plays (check console for load errors)
[ ] Phase 4: Evil code floods screen rapidly
[ ] Phase 5: Vignette appears, distortion starts, jitter begins
[ ] Phase 6: Code breaks into swarm particles
[ ] Phase 7: Say "holy" - white text appears top-left
[ ] Swarm bounces off blessed white areas
[ ] Say more blessings - white area grows downward
[ ] Stop blessing - wait 4 seconds - area starts fading
[ ] Keep blessing - fill entire screen - WIN!
[ ] Test instant win: "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
[ ] Press R - restart works

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Q: Audio not playing?
A: Open console (F12), check for load errors
   Use local web server: python -m http.server 8000
   Then: http://localhost:8000/exorcism-game.html

Q: Blessings not appearing?
A: Check console for "✝️ BLESSING: ..." messages
   Make sure you're in phase 'playing' (after animation)

Q: Swarm not bouncing off blessed areas?
A: They should reverse velocity when hitting white text
   Check that blessed areas are rendering (white text visible)

Q: Game too easy/hard?
A: Edit CONFIG in HTML:
   - Harder: Increase decayRate (faster decay)
   - Easier: Decrease decayRate or increase decayDelay

Q: Animation too fast/slow?
A: Phase timings are hardcoded in update functions
   Terminal: character by character
   Access Granted: 3 seconds
   Code Flood: 5 chars per frame
   Swarm Formation: 3 seconds

EVIL CODE TEXT:
---------------
Includes demonic C++ code with comments like:
- "The flesh is weak, the code is eternal"
- "Your prayers cannot compile here"
- "Despair.h has been included"
- "All your base are belong to darkness"
- Multiple "666 666 666" lines

VISUAL EFFECTS:
---------------
✓ Black vignette (radial gradient from edges)
✓ Wave distortion (CRT-style skew + hue rotation)
✓ Jitter (screen shake every 3 seconds)
✓ Character glitching (random char corruption)
✓ Color glitching (random RGB on characters)

Enjoy exorcising! 👹→✝️
